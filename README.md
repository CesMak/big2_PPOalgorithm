# Big 2 Self-Play Reinforcement Learning AI
Big 2 is a 4 player game of imperfect information with quite a complicated action space (being able to choose to play singles, pairs, three of a kinds, two pairs, straights, flushes, full houses etc from an initial starting hand of 13 cards). This is my implementation of training an AI to play the game purely via self-play using the "Proximal Policy Optimization" algorithm and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked! 

I am currently working on a better GUI to play against but currently if you run generateGUI.py you can play against the trained network which is now able to consistently beat me (who has played this game a lot with my friends!)
